## Introduction
This repository contains 20 projects I have made or will make for the purpose of learning backend development using Golang.

I am building projects from this link: https://roadmap.sh/backend/project-ideas

### *21.01.2026 - Day 1 - Basics of Go Programming Language*

Today I learned a little of the basics of Golang. I learned that Golang applications are made up of go files, which are contained in modules and modules are contained in packages. I learned about Variables, Functions, Data types and Conditional Statements.

One major difference from languages I am used to (like java) is the syntax. Variable data types are declared after the name as opposed to Java (and java like languages). Overall, the developer experience is very pleasant, and I am really excited to continue this journey.
