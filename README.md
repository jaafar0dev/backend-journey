## Introduction
This repository contains 20 projects I have made or will make for the purpose of learning backend development using Golang.

I am building projects from this link: https://roadmap.sh/backend/project-ideas

### *21.01.2026 - Day 1 - Basics of Go Programming Language*

Today I learned a little of the basics of Golang. I learned that Golang applications are made up of go files, which are contained in modules and modules are contained in packages. I learned about Variables, Functions, Data types and Conditional Statements.

One major difference from languages I am used to (like java) is the syntax. Variable data types are declared after the name as opposed to Java (and java like languages). Overall, the developer experience is very pleasant, and I am really excited to continue this journey.


### *22.01.2026 - Day 2 - Basics of Go Programming Language*

Today I learned about arrays, maps, for loops in golang. One thing I really like about golang is how close to the lowlevelness of a language like C and a high level language like python, kind of in between, features like getting the index of a string returns a number instead of a character. Overall I really enjoy using golang. I also solved the "Two Sum" problem on leetcode to solidify my new knowledge of Golang syntax. On to day 3. On to day 3!

### *23.01.2026 - Day 3 - Basics of Go Programming Language (Creating an Termianl ATM System - Part 1)*

Today I learned about more about Arrays, Slices, Maps and Loops, String and Runes, Structs, Interaces and Pointers, as I was watching the tutorial, I felt as though the concepts were not sticking as much as I'd like them to though the tutorial was great and explained alot of concepts very well, [Here's a link to the tutorial on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uiZC0l4Ajw&t=0s), Anyway, I decided to use Gemini to generate project ideas based on a concept I wasn't very clear on. Gemini told me to create ATM simulation system to hammer in functions and control structures. So I paused the tutorial and started building this, after a while, I felt myself understanding these concepts better since I was putting them into practice. I also ran into an issue while creating a transaction history for my ATM system, which was converting the built in time function (time.Now()) into a string. I shall tackle this issue tomorrow and understand.

I also stopped using VS Code because I felt the auto complete features powered by Copilot were NOT helping me learn on my own, So I switched to Notepad++ so I can do everything myself. No AI generated code at all.
Today was fun, I'm really excited to learn more about golang. On to day 4.
